# Introduction
Consumers today are becoming more selective about the businesses they support and where they spend their money. This makes it essential for companies to develop a deep understanding of their customer base in order to tailor their services and marketing strategies more effectively. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into smaller groups that share similar characteristics or behaviours. In the case of a food delivery company for instance, some groups may prioritise convenience and quick delivery, while others might focus on price or healthy options. Recognizing these differences will allow the company to better customise their products, services, and marketing efforts to meet the specific preferences and needs of each segment, enhancing customer satisfaction and ultimately boosting retention and revenue.
# Project Description
In this project, you will act as consultants for ABCDEats Inc. (ABCDE), a fictional food delivery service partnering with a range of restaurants to offer diverse meal options. Your task is to analyse customer data collected over three months from three cities to help ABCDE develop a data-driven strategy tailored to various customer segments. The description of the data is provided under the Dataset Description section of this document. We recommend segmenting customers using multiple perspectives. Examples of segmentation perspectives include value-based segmentation, which groups customers by their economic value; preference or behaviour-based segmentation which focuses on purchasing habits; and demographic segmentation which categorises customers by attributes like age, gender, and income to understand different interaction patterns. Ultimately, the company seeks a final segmentation that integrates these perspectives to enable them to develop a comprehensive marketing strategy.
